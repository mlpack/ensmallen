**ensmallen** is a C++ header-only library for mathematical optimization.

Documentation and downloads: http://ensmallen.org

ensmallen provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective
function to optimize. It also provides a large set of standard and cutting-edge
optimizers that can be used for virtually any mathematical optimization task.
These include full-batch gradient descent techniques, small-batch techniques,
gradient-free optimizers, and constrained optimization.


### Requirements

* C++ compiler with C++11 support
* Armadillo: http://arma.sourceforge.net
