/**
 * Differential evolution is a stochastic evolutionary algorithm used for global
 * optimization. This class implements the best/1/bin strategy of differential
 * evolution to converge a given function to minima.
 *
 * The algorithm works by generating a fixed number of candidates from the
 * given starting point. At each pass through the population, the algorithm
 * mutates each candidate solution to create a trial solution. If the trial
 * solution is better than the candidate, it is replaced in the
 * population.
 *
 * The evolution takes place in two steps:
 * - Mutation
 * - Crossover
 *
 * Mutation is done by generating a new candidate solution from the best
 * candidate of the previous solution and two random other candidates.
 *
 * Crossover is done by mixing the parameters of the candidate solution and the
 * mutant solution. This is done only if a randomly generated number between 0
 * and 1 is greater than the crossover rate.
 *
 * The final value and the parameters are returned by the Optimize() method.
 *
