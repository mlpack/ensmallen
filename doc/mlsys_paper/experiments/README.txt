This directory contains a few utilities for running benchmarks for the paper.

Try 'make run', and hope that you've got all the dependencies installed and
available on your $PATH:

 - python with scipy installed.
 - julia with Optim.jl installed.
 - octave with 'optim' package installed (on Debian see 'octave-optim' package)
 - g++ as the compiler (modify Makefile if desired)
